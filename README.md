<h3 align="center"> Image to Text Optical Character Recognition </h3>

<p align="center">
OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology used to convert text from images, scanned documents, or photos into editable and searchable digital text. It facilitates document digitization, reducing the need for manual data entry, and enabling text search within images. Additionally, OCR enhances accessibility by allowing text to be read by screen readers for visually impaired individuals. Common applications include invoice processing, bank check handling, and digital archiving. The effectiveness of OCR depends on the quality of the scanned images and the capabilities of the OCR algorithms used.
